Calculate contours
==================

Contours are calculated using the :meth:`~.ContourGenerator.lines` and
:meth:`~.ContourGenerator.filled` methods of a :class:`~.ContourGenerator` object
that is obtained by calling the :func:`~.contour_generator` function.
There are many options available for contouring that equate to keyword arguments passed to
the :func:`~.contour_generator` function, these are described in turn below.

Before reading this you should check out the :ref:`quickstart`.

The other main source of information is the :ref:`api`.
