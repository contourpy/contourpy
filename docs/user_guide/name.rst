Algorithm name
--------------

There are four possible algorithms to use for contouring which are identified by the ``name``
keyword argument passed to :func:`~contourpy.contour_generator`. For example:

  >>> cont_gen = contour_generator(name="serial", ...)

The four names are ``mpl2005``, ``mpl2014``, ``serial`` and ``threaded``. The default is ``serial``,
which you should use unless you have a good reason not to.

There are four optional features that the algorithms may support, which are ``corner_mask``,
``quad_as_tri``, ``threads`` and ``z_interp``. This table indicates which algorithms supports which
feature:

.. name_supports::

Also, some algorithms only support a subset of the possible :class:`~contourpy.LineType`
and :class:`~contourpy.FillType` enums; these are discussed in :ref:`line_type` and :ref:`fill_type`
respectively.

mpl2005
^^^^^^^

The original 2005 Matplotlib algorithm, modified to conform to the ``contourpy`` API and so that it
can be wrapped using `pybind11`_. Does not support any of ``corner_mask``, ``quad_as_tri``,
``threads`` or ``z_interp``.

.. warning::

   This algorithm is in ``contourpy`` for historic comparison. No new features or bug fixes will be
   added to it, except for security-related bug fixes.

mpl2014
^^^^^^^

The 2014 Matplotlib algorithm, a replacement of the original 2005 algorithm that added
``corner_mask`` and made the code easier to understand.  Modified to conform to the ``contourpy``
API and so that it can be wrapped using `pybind11`_.  Does not support ``quad_as_tri``, ``threads``
or ``z_interp``.

.. warning::

   This algorithm is in ``contourpy`` for historic comparison. No new features or bug fixes will be
   added to it, except for security-related bug fixes.

serial
^^^^^^

The default algorithm for ``contourpy``, released in 2022, which supports all of the optional
features except for ``threads``. It combines lessons learnt from both of the previous algorithms as
well as adding new features and performance improvements.

threaded
^^^^^^^^

This is a multithreaded version of the ``serial`` algorithm, and requires the domain to be divided
into chunks.  It shares the majority of its code with ``serial`` except:

  #. High-level processing of chunks occurs in parallel using a thread pool.
  #. Creation of `NumPy`_ arrays is limited to a single thread at a time.

.. warning::

   This algorithm is work in progress and should be considered experimental.  It works fine
   in an isolated environment using the ``contourpy`` tests and benchmarks, but needs to be
   rigorously tested in real-world environments that that include mixed Python/C++ code and multiple
   threads before it can be considered production quality.
